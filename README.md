# JavaScript Basics: Variables, Functions, Loops & DOM

This project is a structured practice environment for learning fundamental JavaScript concepts, including variables, conditionals, functions, loops, and DOM manipulation. It demonstrates how these core concepts can be applied to create simple interactive features on a webpage.

## Features

- **Countdown Display**  
  Uses both a `for` loop and a `while` loop to generate a countdown from 5 to "Go! ðŸš€" dynamically in the DOM.

- **Text Toggle**  
  Allows the user to show or hide a paragraph on the page with a button click.

- **Background Color Changer**

## How It Works

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. On page load, youâ€™ll be prompted to enter your name for a personalized greeting.
3. Use the provided buttons to:
   - Enter your age and get a contextual response.
   - Run a countdown timer that displays numbers and ends with "Go!".
   - Toggle a paragraph's visibility on and off.
4. Click anywhere on the page background to cycle through background colors.
